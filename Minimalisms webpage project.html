        <h5>Hi,This is Thaw Zin, And I am a minimalist.</h5>
        <p>The minimalism does not properly have a philosophical idea behind the topic like stoicism or Taoism. But according to my experience the underline philosophy is the stoicism. The word "minimalism" was originated from an abstract art designs developed in the USA in the 1960s which were composed of simple geometric shapes based on square and rectangle. In this page I'm going to briefly explain</p>

        <h5 id="PM">The philosophy of Minimalism.</h5>
        <p>If you search it on the internet. It said the minimalism philosophy encourages people to have a life of more freedom. Which is basically the stoicism in a nutshell. People are imprisoned by the imagined orders like laws, the value of money ,power and religions. Once Dr.Harari ,the author of the book called Sapien wrote in his book suggested that these imagined orders enable humans to trust other humans because they believe the same stories and follow the same rules, even if they are complete strangers. Homo Sapien (Human) can cooperate in a colossal scale which now other life form on Earth have achieved before. But even tho it may be a good thing for the humankind as a whole. At the idividual level, things got complicated. I get tired of these orders ,laws and money. Minimalism is the freedom from these strict orders.</p>

        <h5 id="UP">How is it connect to the Stoicism and Taoism?</h5>
        <p>The Stoicim is originally a school of philosophy that hail from ancient Greece and Rome in the early part of the 3rd century,BC. It help reduces negative emotions and hone individuals virtues of character. You can learn more about stoicism by books from the ancient philosophers like Zeno, Aristo, Seneca and Marcus Aurelius.  </p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism" target="blank">click this link for more about stoicism.</a>
        <p>Taoism (Daoism) which is also a religion from China holds that human and animals should live in balance with the Tao the universe, Taoists belive that the universe is always in flex and there is nothing one can do to change the flow. The best way is to live along the flow of the universe. Bad things are indeed going to happen as if the fast-flowing river, there will be obstacles for sure. We just have to accept things as they are. You can learn more about Taosim by Tao Te Ching, who is the founder of the philosophy.  </p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoism" target="blank">more about Taiosm.</a>

        <h5 id="E">My Experiences</h5>
        <p>As I am a Buddist, I have a very peculiar way of beliving in the Gautama Buddha. Because I don't accept the things that are supernatural ,higher power , or superhuman like ideas which are common throughout religions but rather I belive in pure philosophy of Buddha. As far as my knoweledge go and from what I have had learned, The Buddha does not accept the Gods of Hinduism or even the imagined orders. But rather he found out the truth about life, which we are all going through suffering after suffering. And life itself is nothing but suffering, it was indeed inevitable . He find the way to escape from which this cycle of living hell by many ways which is the Nirvana. That's why he was named 'Buddha' which translate to 'The Enlightenment'. The ideas and philosophy of Buddha is what I accept. So just what Buddhism taught me that the life is one suffering is what I found everyday in my life and my surrounding. People are chasing behind money , power, and moralities without ever accepting the true identity of what they are. The result of that is that these people suffered , imprisoned by the orders and laws of the goverment. I myself is not good or effective at expressing about these topics. But I find a youtuber who exactly articulate what is on my mind. His name is 'shiey'.He is also a minimalist and he go to abandoned cities, restricted areas, and mountains, he climb to phone towers , power plants and high building which he explained it is freedom. And in one of his movie, he explained about these laws and orders and how he don't like them and why. So you should at least try and check him out.</p>
